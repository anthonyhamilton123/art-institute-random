## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I built this by making a random number generator, and then multiplying this by the estimated number of ID's within the collection. Then this became the source for the URL to draw information. I then designed a simple card layout that would display all this information.

## Optimizations

- create DarkMode in localStorage > pull from computer?
- Would like to make an option for multiple images side by side, so students can write comparison essays
- create a way to account for all items in the collection
- create a method to search the database
- create a way to remember artworks 
- make into mobile app


## Lessons Learned:

I learned that I could make API's and design simple apps!
